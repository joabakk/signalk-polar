You can create one with`curl -X POST http://localhost:8086/query?q=CREATE+DATABASE+boatdata`The plugin writes only `self` data. It converts Signal K paths to InfluxDb `measurement` keys in CamelCase format, eg. `navigationPosition`.Adding support for non-self data would be pretty easy by adding context as InfluxDB tags.If you want to try this out I suggest you try [InfluxCloud](https://cloud.influxdata.com/) (have not tried yet myself) or run InfluxDb locally with Docker by using [ready made Dockerfiles](https://github.com/tutumcloud/influxdb).Compatible with InfluxDB 1.x.",
